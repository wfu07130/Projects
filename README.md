# RSA

Decryption and Encryption Program using RSA
Using Modular Expontiation Algorithm and Euclidean Algorithm

To encrypt:
 - enter ENCRYPT command followed with:
     - output file name
     - a n value 
     - the message to be encrypted

To decrypt:
 - enter DECRYPT command followed with:
    - input file to be decrypted
    - output file to contain decrypted message

TO COMPILE:
 - just do "make" command in directory
